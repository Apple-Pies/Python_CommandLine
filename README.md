# Python_CommandLine
A cli in Python.
Run shell.py file.
shell.py executes commands via interpreter.py!

Note:
when commands work, fault handlers will still show
This will be depreicated soon!
I will be fixing the command that changes directories in the near future.
#Tips:
Type "help()" for a list of commands and information on what those commands do.
#Note: When you type in a command, DO NOT TYPE IN THE OPTIONAL PARAMETERS, they come after you type the command itself.
Example - If you type "--file -a create [name] [extension] [folder]", only type in "--file -a create", the other parameters in the square brackets, are just notfying you about the corresponding prompts.
