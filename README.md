# Python_CommandLine
A cli in Python.
Run shell.py file.
shell.py executes commands via interpreter.py!

Note:
when commands work, fault handlers will still show
This will be depreicated soon!
I will be fixing the command that changes directories in the near future.
#Tip:
type help(), for a list of commands, and information :)
