# shellprcsr:
A cli made in the Python programming language.

# Usage:
1) Run the "shell.py" file.

# Important Tips:
Type "help()" for a list of commands and information on what those commands do.
When you type in a command, DO NOT TYPE IN THE OPTIONAL PARAMETERS, they come after you type the command itself.
For example, if you type "--file -a create [name] [extension] [folder]", only type in "--file -a create", the other parameters in the square brackets, are just notfying you about the corresponding prompts.

# Info:
The "shell.py" file executes commands via the "interpreter.py" file!

# Note:
When commands work, fault handlers will still show.
This will be depreicated soon!
I will be fixing the command that changes the current working directory(cd-like), in the near future.
For now, that command isn't working properly the way it should.

# Credits:
Thanks to TechwithTim, I was able to create a simple OpenCV camera function.
